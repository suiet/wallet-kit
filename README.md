# Warning: Potential Scam Links in Comments ‚ö†Ô∏è

We've recently observed SCAMMERS posing as repository maintainers and posting phishing links in the comments. **Please DO NOT trust any links containing the words "HELP CENTER" or "ONLINE ASSISTANT," as they are SCAMS!** Only trust individuals with a "member" badge, as they are the official maintainers of Suiet.

This repository is intended for developer questions, bug reports, or feature requests.
